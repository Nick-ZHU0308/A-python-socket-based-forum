This is a socket-based web forum simulate pattern. Now this pattern is still under development, I upload the file at April 21th night because I need o do a modify, and if finally it fail, we can still have the spark to rebuild this project.  
<br>Now is the second version. I solved the LST problem, now is handling the MSG message ipper case problem, and the order of record in thread problem.
<br> AET 3:56 April 22, I nearly completed it. Except the upload and download function.
